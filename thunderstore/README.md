# EasierSkillCurve
Makes required skill experience curve linear in Valheim.

As of right now the formula for required experience to get next skill level in Valheim grows exponentially. This mod makes it so it increases linearly starting from 1 experience for level 1 and increasing by 1 each level.

Probably required on server and all clients.
